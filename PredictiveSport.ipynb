    "A football game generates much more events and it is very important and interesting to take into account the context in which those events were generated. This dataset should keep sports analytics enthusiasts awake for long hours as the number of questions that can be asked is huge.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nearly 25,000 soccer games from all leagues all over the world. The fields in the data set are: Columns A to E contains information about the league, home and away teams, date etc Columns F, G and H contain the odds for the home win, draw and away win Columns I to BQ contain the team statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Home team stats are prefixed with a \"h\" similarly, away team stats are prefixed with an \"a\". Examples include ladder position (which is a term for a rank in a group -  <a href=https://www.flashscore.com.au/football/europe/euro/standings/> here </a> an example), games played, goals conceded, away games won etc. Columns BR to CA contain final result information. That is the result, the full time result and if available, the half time score as well.\n",

    "For each game there is: \n",
    "1. Statistics on the two teams, such as ladder position, win-loss history, games played \n",
    "2. Odds for home win, draw, away win (some-times is zero if odds not available) \n",
    "3. The result for that game (including the half time result if available\n",

    "- create predictive models for football games in order to bet on football outcomes. This involves training a model for a subset of features e.g. (home,odd,ladder), and predicting a target variable e.g. win, draw, loss. Consider the following three algorithms. Comment on the performances if you are able to run two or three of them \n",
